# ICJ-Verbatim-Record-Download
# This is a python program designed for downloading verbatim records of oral proceedings in ICJ cases published on its official website.
# The developer is a law student who studied C++ and is self-teaching python. Thus, the code is rather primitive but has proven to be able to achieve its goal. 
# This program can be used to search legal arguments not mentioned in the judgement but are likely to arise in oral proceedings.
